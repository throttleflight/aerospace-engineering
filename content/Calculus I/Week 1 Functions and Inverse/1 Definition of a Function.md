title: Definition of a Function
---

#### **Definition:** 
```
A function f: ℝ -→ ℝ associates to each number x in its domain exactly one number f(x).
```
---
###### Example 1:
```
H: ℝ -→ ℝ associates to each number t > 0 the height of a falling object t seconds after it was dropped.
```
###### Example 2:
```
P: ℝ -→ ℝ associates to each number T ≥ 0 the pressure of an ideal gas at temperature T Kelvins.
```

Falling Object Formula:
$$
H(t) = h - \frac{1}{2}gt^2
$$
So, for $h = 200$ m and $g = 10$ $m/s^2$
$$
H(5) = 200 - \frac{1}{2}\cdot_{}10\cdot_{}5^2 = 75
$$
$$
H(3) = 200 - \frac{1}{2}\cdot_{}10\cdot_{}3^2 = 155
$$
Ideal Gas Formula:
$$
P(T) = \frac{nRT}{V}
$$
---
#### **Definition:**
```
The graph of a function f: ℝ -→ ℝ is the curve going through all the points (x, f(x)) for x in the domain of f.
```
###### Graph Example:
![[Falling Object.png]]
$$
Falling Object: H(t)=200-\frac{1}{2}\cdot_{}10\cdot_{}t^2
$$
![[Ideal Gas.png]]
$$
Ideal Gas: P(T)=45\cdot_{}8\cdot{}T
$$
To find values from the graph, you can use a reading off way. For falling object, when t is equal to 5, then the output which is the height will be 75.

To figure out if a graph is a function or not, we use the Vertical Line test.
>[!Theorem]
>A curve in the plane is the graph of a function over a certain domain if every vertical line at x-values in that domain intersects the curve exactly once.

###### Example 1:
![[Example 1.png]]

Using the vertical line test, there is only 1 point on each vertical line, therefore making this a function.
> [!Caution]
> A circle is not a function as it does not pass the Vertical Line test.

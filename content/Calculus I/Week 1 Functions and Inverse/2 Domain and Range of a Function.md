#school-note 
A function can be seen as a machine that transforms an input to an output.
#### **Definition:**
```
A function f: A -→ B is a rule that assigns to each element x in the set A, a unique element f(x) in the set B.
```
In this definition, the set A of all possible input values is called the **domain**.
The set B is called the **co-domain** of the function.

#### **Definition:**
```
The range R of a function f: A -→ B is the set of all possible values of f(x) as x varies throughout the domain.

#### **Definition:**
```
The range R of a function f: A -→ B is the set of all possible values of f(x) as x varies throughout the domain A.
```
>[!Example]
$$R = {f(x) | x ∈ A}$$
∈ represents set membership and means "is an element of".

#### **Definition of Maximal Domain:**
```
The maximal domain of f(x) consists of all real numbers x for which the value f(x) is a real number.
```
> [!example]
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$$
Maximal domain: { x ∈ ℝ | x ≠ 0} = (-∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞)

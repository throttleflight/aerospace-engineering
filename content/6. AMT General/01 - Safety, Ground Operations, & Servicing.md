#### Electrical Safety
When electricity is applied to the human body
- Severe burns in the entrance & exit
- Nervous system damaged or destroyed
#### Fire Safety
- Keep areas around electrical work or equipment clean and free of unnecessary flammable substances.
- Never put electrical wires where they may be walked or run over by other equipment.
- When wires inside a power cord is broken, current is increased, meaning more heat generated than the insulation coatings.
- Repair or replace damaged equipment.
#### Safety Compressed Gases
- Inspect air hoses for breaks and worn spots. Replace unsafe hoses.
- Make sure there is no leak.
- Maintain in-line oilers in operating condition if they are installed.
- Ensure the system has water sumps installed and drained at regular intervals.
- Filter air that is used for spray painting. (Remove oil & water)
- Never use compressed air to clean hands or clothing. Pressure may be too much force.
- Never spray compressed air near other personnel.
- Straighten, coil, and properly store air hoses when not in use.
- Use tire dollies and other appropriate equipment to mount or remove aircraft tires.
#### Safety Hazardous Materials
In the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) or also known as the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), there is a label of a risk diamond. It is a four-color segmented diamond that represents flammability (red), reactivity (yellow), health (blue), and special hazard (white).
- Flammability, Reactivity, & Health: Number from 0 to 4. (0 representing little or no hazard, 4 representing very hazardous)
- Special Hazard: Represented by a word or abbreviation. (e.g. RAD for radiation, ALK for alkali materials, Acid for acidic materials, CARC for carcinogenic materials, and W with a line for high reactivity to water.)
##### Example of a risk diamond:

#### Safety Machine Tools
- Wear eye protection.
- Securely clamp all work.
- Set the proper revolutions per minute (RPM) for the material being used.
- Do not allow the spindle to feed beyond its limits of travel.
- Stop the machine before adjusting work or attempting to remove jammed work.
- Clean area when finished.
#### Flight Line Safety
##### Hearing Protection
- Always wear hearing protection when available. (May be external or internal)
	- Earmuffs/Headphones are external protection.
	- Hearing protection that fits into auditory canals are internal protection.
- Essential when working with pneumatic drills, rivet guns, or other loud tools. 
##### FOD
Foreign Object Damage is any damage to the aircraft. 
- Never leave tools around intake of a turbine engine.
- Modern gas turbine engine creates low-pressure area in front of the engine, causing any loose objects to be drawn into the engine.
	- Exhaust can propel loose objects great distances with enough force to damage anything that is hit.
##### Safety Around Planes & Helicopters
- Be aware of propellers.
- Never assume the pilot can see you, stay within the pilot's view while on ramp.
- Turbine engine intakes and exhaust are very hazardous.
- Smoking & open flames are not permitted.
- Be aware of aircraft fluids that can be detrimental to the skin.
- Observe rotor heads and blades to see if they are level. Allow maximum clearance when approaching the helicopter.
- Approach the helicopter in view of pilot.
- Never approach a helicopter carrying anything with vertical height. Can cause blade damage and injury to the individual.
- Never approach single-rotor helicopter from the rear. Tail rotor is invisible when operated.
- Always go around the nose of the helicopter to get to the other side.
#### Fire
Reactants:
- Fuel - Combining oxygen, releasing more heat.
- Heat - Accelerates combination of oxygen and fuel, releasing more heat.
- Oxygen - Element that combines chemically with another substance through oxidation. Rapid oxidation is noticed with the release of heat and light, combustion or burning.

##### Classification
Class A: Involves ordinary combustible materials.
- Wood, cloth, paper, upholstery materials, etc.
Class B: Involves flammable petroleum products.
- Combustible liquids, greases, solvents, paints, etc.
Class C: Involves energized electrical wiring/equipment.
- Wires, cords, electrical, etc.
Class D: Involves metal.
- Flammable metals, etc.
##### Extinguishers
Carbon Dioxide ($CO_{2}$): Class A, B, and C
- Never use on Class D fires, water extinguishers can cause explosive expansion on metal.
Halogenated Hydrocarbon: Class B and C
Carbon Tetrachloride (Halon 104 - $CCl_{4}$): Toxicity Rating (3)
- Not recommended to be used. Creates hydrochloric acid vapor, chlorine, and phosgene gas, when used on ordinary fires.
Methyl Bromide (Halon 1001 - $CH_{3}Br$): Toxicity Rating (2)
- Corrosive to aluminum alloys, magnesium, and zinc.
- Not recommended for aircraft use.
Chlorobromomethane (Halon 1011 - $CH_{2}ClBr$): Toxicity Rating (3)
- Liquefied Gas
- Not recommended for aircraft use.
Dibromodifluoromethane (Halon 1202 - $CBr_{2}F_{2}$): Toxicity Rating (4)
- Not recommended for aircraft use.
Bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211 - $CBrClF_{2}$): Toxicity Rating (5)
- Liquefied Gas
- Colorless, noncorrosive, evaporates rapidly, no residue.
- Does not freeze or cause cold burns, does not harm fabrics, metals, etc.
- Rapidly on fires, producing heavy blanketing mist, eliminating oxygen from fire source.
Bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301 - $CF_{3}Br$): Toxicity Rating (6)
- Liquefied Gas
- All characteristics of Halon 1211
- Vapor spray, more difficult to direct
Dry Powder: Effective on Class B and C, best for Class D
- Varies from gas cartridge charges, stored pressure, force powder out of container.
- Not recommended for aircraft use, except on metal fires.
- Cleanup is difficult, may damage electronic or other delicate equipment.

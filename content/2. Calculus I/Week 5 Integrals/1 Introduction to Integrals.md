Integration is the opposite reaction of differentiation. There is including a signed area, compounding a process, center of mass/average.
> [!abstract] Notation
> 
> The integral of the function $f(x)$ over the interval $[a, b]$ is denoted:
> 
> $$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$$

In the notation above, $[a, b]$ is the interval of integration, $\int$ is the integral sign, $a$ is the lower bound, $b$ is the upper bound, and $f(x)$ is the integrand.

#### Area
> [!abstract] Definition/Theorem
> 
> Suppose $f(x)$ is a function that is non-negative for all $x \in [a, b]$, then $\int_{a}^b f(x)dx = A$, where $A$ is the surface area between the graph of $f$ and the x-axis over the interval $[a, b]$.

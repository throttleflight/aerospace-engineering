#### Implicit Functions
##### Explicit Form:
- $y=3x^3\ln{x}$
- $y=\sin(x^2-4)$
- $y=\frac{x^5+7x^2}{x^2+1}$
##### Implicit Form:
- $x^3+y^3=6xy$
- $x^2+y^2=9$

An explicit formula is a function that expresses one variable as a function of the other, while an implicit formula represents a relationship between variables without expressing one variable in terms of the other.

For a function that passes the vertical line test, the slope of a tangent line to the curve can be found by explicit differentiation. For a function that does not pass the vertical line test, we can use implicit differentiation.

When we are finding the tangent line of a circle, we do not have an explicit formula. In this case, we can split the circle in half.

The circle above is split into 2 equations.
- $y=\sqrt{ 9-x^2 }$
- $y=-\sqrt{ 9-x^2 }$

The tangent of any of these equations would just be the derivative of the equation. Take the first equation as an example.
$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-x}{\sqrt{ 9-x^2 }}$
For the lower half, it would be...
$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x}{\sqrt{ 9-x^2 }}$
#### Implicit Differentiation
Equation of the circle: $x^2+y^2=9$
We can say that $y=y(x)$ as it is defined implicitly.
$x^2+(y(x))^2=9$
by solving for the derivative using the chain rule...
$2x+2y(x)y'(x)=0$
rearranging this equation creates
$2y(x)y'(x) = -2x$
solving for $\frac{dy}{dx}$
$y'(x)=\frac{-2x}{2y(x)}=-\frac{x}{y(x)}$
Lastly, it simplifies to
$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-x}{y}$
By applying this to the circle, we can get the 2 equations of the upper half and the lower half.

Another example can be used on the folium of Descartes. The equation is $x^3+y^3=6xy$ and when $y=y(x)$ is defined implicitly, $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{6y-3x^2}{3y^2-6x}$.

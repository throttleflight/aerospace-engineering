title: Derivatives of Inverse (Trigonometric) Functions

Let's take the equation of $y=\arcsin(x)$.
From previous sections, we do know that $y=\arcsin(x)$ is equal to $\sin(y)=x$.

>$y = \arccos(x)$ and $\cos(y) = x$
> 
>$y=\arctan(x)$ and $\tan(y) = x$

Remember that $y$ is equal to the function.
Then, the derivative of that would become $\cos(y)\frac{dy}{dx} = 1$ which simplifies to $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{\cos(y)}=\frac{1}{\cos(\arcsin(x))}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1-x^2 }}$. This pertains the information below.

> $\frac{d}{dx}\arcsin(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1-x^2 }}$
> 
> $\frac{d}{dx}\arccos(x) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{ 1-x^2 }}$
> 
> $\frac{d}{dx}\arctan(x) = \frac{1}{{ 1+x^2 }}$

This will be the same information for any other similarly to $\arccos$ and $arctan$.

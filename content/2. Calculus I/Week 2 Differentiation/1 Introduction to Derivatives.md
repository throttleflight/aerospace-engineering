#### Rate of Change
>[!Definition]
>The rate of change of the function $y=f(x)$ over the interval $[a, b]$ is given by:
>$$\frac{\triangle{y}}{\triangle{x}} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$
#### Instantaneous Rate of Change
>[!Definition]
>Letting the width $\triangle{x}$ of the interval $[a, b]$ approach 0, the rate of change of the function $f(x)$ will approach the derivative $f'(a)$ at the point of $a$:
>$$f'(a) = \lim_{ \triangle{x} \to 0 }\frac{\triangle{y}}{\triangle{x}} = \lim_{ b \to a }\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$

##### Graph:

In this graph, if we keep on making the interval smaller and smaller, then the line will become a tangent. A tangent line has only 1 point touching the parabola line.

>[!Definition]
>Given a function $f(x)$ the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at the point $a$ in the domain is given by the equation
>$$y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$$

#### Derivative at a Point
>[!Definition]
>The slope of the tangent line to the function $f$ at the point $a$ is denoted by $f'(a)$ or $\frac{df}{dx}(a)$ and called the derivative of $f$ at $a$.

There are some cases where a function doesn't have a good differentiable point. There can be a "jump" which is where the graph breaks in the middle and jumps to another point and continues on. Or, there may be a "kink" where it looks like a v, similarly in absolute value graphs.
#### Derivative of a Function
>[!Definition]
>Given a function $f : D \to ℝ$ that is differentiable at each point $a$ in $D$ we define the derivative $f' : D\to ℝ$ as the function that associates the derivative of $f$ at $a$ to each point $a$ in the domain $D$.

>[!Notation]
>The derivative of $f$ is also denoted $\frac{df}{dx}$.
>The second derivative $(f')'=f''$ is also denoted $\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$
>The third derivative $(f'')' = f^{(3)}$ is also denoted $\frac{d^3f}{dx^3}$
>The *n*th derivative $f^{(n)}$ is also denoted $\frac{d^nf}{dx^n}$

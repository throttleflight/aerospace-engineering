title: Linearization
---

Let's take an example of a sine function.

If we take a closer look at the point $(0, 1)$, we can see that it is almost like a straight line.

#### Linearization
>[!Definition]
>Given a function $y=f(x)$ the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at the point $x=a$ is given by the equation:
>
>$$y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$$
>
>The linear function whose graph is the tangent line at $x=a$ is called the linearization of $f$ at $a$:
>
>$$L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$$

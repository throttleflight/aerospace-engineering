#### Differential Equations
>[!Definition]
>A differential equation is an equation of the form:
>
>$$F(x,y,y',y^n, \dots, y^{(n)}) = 0$$
>
>where $y=y(x)$ is a function of the variable $x$.
>
>- We call $n$ the **order** of the differential equation.
>- The variable $x$ is called the **independent** variable
>- and the variable $y$ is called the **dependent** variable.

#### General Solution
>[!Definition]
>Given a differential equation
>
>$$F(x,y,y',y^n, \dots, y^{(n)})=0$$
>
>a **general solution** is given by a formula for a function $y(x)$ that depends on $n$ independent arbitrary constants $c_{1}, \dots, c_{n}$ such that **any** particular solution is obtained by choosing the appropriate values for the constants.

#### Initial Value Problem
>[!Definition]
>An *n*th order **initial value problem** is given by a differential equation
>
>$$F(x,y,y', \dots, y^{(n)})=0$$
>
>together with prescribed values at some initial point $x=a$:
>
>$$y(a)=y_{0}$$
>
>$$y'(a)=y_{1}$$
>
>$$\dots$$
>
>$$y^{(n)}(a)=y_{n}$$

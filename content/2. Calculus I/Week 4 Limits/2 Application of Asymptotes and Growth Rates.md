#### Growth Rates
>[!Definition]
>Consider functions $p_{A}(x)$ and $p_{B}(x)$ that grow as $x$ increases.
>
>If
>
>$$\lim_{ x \to \infty } \frac{p_{A}(x)}{p_{B}(x)} = 0$$
>
>then $p_{B}(x)$ has a higher growth rate than $p_{A}(x)$.
>
>If
>
>$$\lim_{ x \to \infty } \frac{p_{A}(x)}{p_{B}(x)} = c > 0$$ then $p_{A}(x)$ has the same growth rate as $p_{B}(x)$.
>
>If $\frac{p_{A}(x)}{p_{B}(x)}$ keeps increasing then $p_{A}(x)$ has a higher growth rate than $p_{B}(x)$.

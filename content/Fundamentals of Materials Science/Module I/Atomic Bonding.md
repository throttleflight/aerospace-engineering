#### Bonding Forces and Energies
The potential energy between two atoms has an equilibrium position where in the potential energy curve, it corresponds to a minimum where the atoms are at their equilibrium states. This is called equilibrium interatomic spacing.

Bond energy ($E_{0}$) represents the energy required to separate the two atoms to an infinite separation:
- Attraction: Depends on the particular type of chemical bond.
- Repulsion: Overlap of the negatively charged electron clouds.

#### Interatomic Bond Types
- Primary or Chemical Bond:
	- Ionic
	- Covalent
	- Metallic
- Secondary or Physical Bond:
	- Van der Waals Bond
	- Hydrogen Bonding
--> Ionic and Covalent bonds are stronger than Metallic bonds.
--> Primary bonds is stronger than Secondary bonds.
#### Bond Lengths
The average (equilibrium) distance between nuclei of two bonded atoms:
- Primary Bonds: 0.1-0.2 nm
- Secondary Bonds: 0.2-0.5 nm
--> The stronger bonds will have smaller distance between the two atoms and the energy well or minimum is deeper.
#### Primary Bonds
##### Ionic Bonding
Example: Sodium Chloride (NaCl) (Ionic Bonding)
- Electron transfer to form positive and negative ions.
- Attraction: Coulomb's Force
- Non-directional

Ionic Character (IC):
>[!Info] Equation

>$$= \{1-[-(0.25)(X_{A}-X_{B})^2]\}\cdot 100$$

>where $X_{A}$ and $X_{B}$ are the electronegativities for the respective elements

##### Metallic Bonding
E.g., Cu, Ag, Au, Al, Ni, Pt, Cr, Mo, etc
- Non-Directional Bonding
- Free electron cloud is due to delocalization.
- Found in all elemental metals.
- The free electrons serve as a "glue" to hold the ion cores together -- bonding.
#### Secondary Bonds
##### van der Waals Bonding
- Much weaker than primary bonds.
- Originate from atomic/molecular dipoles: separation of positive and negative charges.
How dipoles are formed:
1. Fluctuating induced dipole bonds
2. Polar molecule-induced dipole bonds
3. Permanent dipole bonds (hydrogen bonding)
##### Hydrogen Bonding
- Second strongest bond - a special polar molecule bond.
- Examples: $HF$, $H_{2}O$, $NH_{3}$, $H-F$, $H-O$, $H-N$, bonds have positively charged bare proton at hydrogen end.
#### Bonding Character and Properties
- Strongly bonded materials --> high melting and boiling temperatures
- For primary bonds, covalent and ionic bonds are generally stronger than metallic bonds
- Thermal and electronic properties depends on free electrons cloud.
- Mechanical properties of solids depends on strength of bonds as well as the directional nature (i.e., crystal structure) --> to be elaborated

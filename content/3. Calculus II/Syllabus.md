### Syllabus: Mastering Mathematics for Engineers: Calculus II: Multivariable functions
---
### Index

This course is part of our Mastering Mathematics for Engineers program: a series of MOOCs to refresh and review your bachelor level mathematics. This is the first of two Calculus MOOCs - **Calculus II.**

In this course we focus on functions of several variables. In the first week you will learn how to approach and appreciate such functions, in weeks two trough four you will learn about differentiation and its applications and in weeks five and six you will learn how to integrate functions of two or three variables.  

We use examples that are based on real-life applications and allow you to practice your mathematical skills in an engineering context.

**Learning objectives**

1.     Visualize multivariable functions in various ways and interpret their formulas

2.     Compute partial and directional derivatives and interpret the result

3.     Obtain information about extremes by considering (partial) derivatives

4.     Integrate functions of two and three variables using several integration techniques

5.     Analyze challenging engineering problems using these techniques.

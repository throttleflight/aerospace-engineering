#### Drawing the graph of a function $f(x,y)$
1. Take a point $(x,y)$ in the domain of $f$
2. Calculate $z=f(x,y)$
3. Plot all points $(x,y,z)$

#### Constructing a contour plot of a function $f(x,y)$
- Take a level on the 3 dimensional graph and your contour is there.

#### Level curves and contour maps
>[!Definition]
>A level curve of a function $f$ of two variables is a curve in $‚Ñù^2$ with equation $f(x,y) = K$, where $K$ is a constant (in the range of $f$). A plot with several level curves is called a contour map.

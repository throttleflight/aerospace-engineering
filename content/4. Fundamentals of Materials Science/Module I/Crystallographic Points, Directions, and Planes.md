#### Point Coordinates
>[!Definition]
>Fractional multiples of the unit cell edge lengths.

#### Crystallographic Directions
- Crystallographic Direction: A line between two points, or a vector.
- Any directions parallel to each other are equivalent and have identical indices.
- Specific directions are indicated by square brackets, $[u,v,w]$, and the negative direction is indicated by a bar on top of the corresponding index.
#### Crystallographic Planes
Any two planes parallel to each other are equivalent and have identical Miller indices.
1. If the plane passes the origin, then construct a parallel plane that doesn't pass the origin, or select a new origin.
2. Find the intercepts of the plane along the axes, $x$, $y$, $z$.
3. Take reciprocals of the intercepts.
4. Convert into smallest integers in the same exact ratio.
5. Enclose in parenthesis $(u,v,w)$.
#### Determination of Planar (Miller) Indices
For cubic crystals (only), planes and directions having the same indices are perpendicular to one another.
#### Family of Crystallographic Planes
- Several nonparallel planes with different indices are crystallographic equivalent, i.e., a family of crystallographic planes.
- Parenthesis --> Braces
- Caution has to be executed when the lattice is not cubic.
#### Hexagonal Structure
- Four indices are used instead of 3 indices.
- $\frac{c}{a}$ varies for different structures.
- $\frac{c}{a}=1.633$ for hexagonal close-packed (hep) structure.
#### Linear and Planar Atomic Densities

$$LD = \frac{Number \space of \space atoms \space centered \space on \space direction \space vector}{Length \space of \space direction \space vector}$$

$$PD=\frac{Number \space of \space atoms \space centered \space on \space a \space plane}{Area \space of \space plane}$$

#### Stacking Sequence in FCC and HCP Structures

![[FCC and HCP.png| center]]

$(a)$ A portion of a close-packed plane of atoms; $A$, $B$, and $C$ position are indicated.

$(b)$ The $AB$ stacking for close-packed atomic planes.

##### Stacking
- close-packed crystal structure
- close-packed plane of atoms
- FCC $\{1\space 1 \space 1\}$ $ABCABCABC...$
- HEP $\{0\space 0 \space 0 \space 1\}$ $ABABABAB...$

#### Materials v.s. Civilization
##### Stone Age (ancient time ~ 5000 BC, ceramics)
- Paleolithic
- Mesolithic
- Neolithic
##### Bronze Age (~3000-5000 BC, Cu-Sn Alloy)
- Bronze material of a copper-tin alloy.
- Usage of phase diagrams to understand how it was produced.
	- By temperature and composition combination.
>[!Definition]
>Phases: Regions with uniform chemical composition and crystal structure.
##### Iron Age
- Material used is "Steel"
	- Combination of iron and carbon elements (Fe-C)
##### Information Technology (1950s-present, semiconductors)
- Usage of silicon (Si) and materials for computers, etc.
	- Has certain chemical structures.
>[!Definition]
>Information Technology: Electron band structure of silicon.

#### Material Division
1. Chemical Composition: Metals, Ceramics, Polymers, Composites
2. Properties
>[!Definition]
>Structural Materials: Can maintain the shape and structure under **force field**, and are used for **structural application**.

>[!Definition]
>Functional Materials: Have certain response under the individual or combined effect from electrical, magnetic, optic, thermal, acoustic, and chemical fields, and are used for **functional applications**.	

 3. Crystallinity
>[!Definition]
>Single Crystals: The translational symmetry and periodical arrangement of atoms (or molecules) exist in the entire body of the material.

>[!Definition]
>Polycrystals: Made up of a number of single crystals.

>[!Definition]
>Amorphous Materials: There is no long-range order and translational symmetry in the material.

>[!Definition]
>Quasi-crystals: There is no translational symmetry as in crystals, but there is some periodical arrangement of atoms in the structure.
